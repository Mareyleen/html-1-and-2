			<h1 style="color: darkred;">Culture</h1>
			<p><em> "Men and women are not only themselves; they are the stories they overheard, the food they ate, the sports they followed, the religion they believe and the God they worship" - (W. Somerest Maugham)</em></p>
			<p>Culture is lived in different way by each of us. I love to experience the culture of different people in my country! From the rich traditional delicacies to the colourful ensemble of beautiful cloth patterns which all encapsulate the richness of my country.</p>
			<p>Africa has a rich tradition of arts and crafts in a variety of woodcarvings, sculpture, paintings, pottery and dresses.</p>
			<p>I love made in Ghana wears! Not only do they have beautiful colors, but it tells the richness of the nation.</p>
			<p>However, in recent times, it is evident that Africans are adopting the western cultures in respect to their lifestyle, norms, values and mentality.</p>

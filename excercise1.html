<h1 style="color: darkred;">Family Bonding</h1>
<p><em>"A Family that reads together; grows together"</em></p>
<p>We all have those cherished books that made a big impression on us growing up. Many of us look back on them with the hopes to one day share them with our own children and impart the same values we picked up from their pages.</p>
<p>Growing up, I enjoyed reading Charles Dickens books and The Adventures of Robin Hood because I love the fictional characters played in these books.</p>
